----------
[ ] Need to add a short paragraph to the introduction section.
[ ] Revision needs to be bumped to something new
[ ] Date needs to be modified for the deliverable date
[ ] Revision history needs to be updated
[ ] Dr. Delugach commented that our function point analysis was low.
    I'm not sure if this is because he didn't realize we only did
	the estimate for the single use case. It probably would be good
	to indicate as such or we need to re-evaluate function points
	at a project-level scope now that we have a better idea of the
	inputs and outputs of the software.
[ ] Teem meetings need to be added, super short summary provided here:

        2014/10/14: Final review of the initial use case.
        2014/10/15: Delegated remaining use case out to pairs.
        2014/10/21: Meeting to check use case status.
        
        Any pair meetings:
        2014/10/18: Angela and Anthony worked on their use cases

[ ] Project schedule needs to be updated
[ ] Add additional terms in glossary
        - Booked Seat
        - Locked Seat
[ ] Integrate use cases into document.
[ ] Move function point analysis into part 2 of the document.
[ ] Add preliminary QA audit somewhere to the document (part 2?)
[ ] Add the 'next steps' section to part 2 of the document.
